\description{
This function uses interpolated MN colors to form a color palette for graphical purposes. The three main palettes are "main", "blue", and "green".
"Main" is composed of MN branded colors, using interpolated colors for gradiation, sorted in the arrangement of the color wheel (with a small deviation -- can you see it!?)
